# chatbot.om

Marketing site for chatbot.om, Oman's sovereign AI chatbot for websites and
WhatsApp. Next.js App Router, Tailwind v4, deployed on Netlify.

It is the sister site of [customercare.om](https://customercare.om) (the
`voxcare-static` repository). The two share a design system deliberately: the
token block at the top of `src/app/globals.css` is kept byte-identical with
that project's, so a palette or type change is applied to both by copying that
block across. Everything below the `Homepage` banner comment in that file is
specific to this site's landing page.

## Structure

```
src/app/          routes; collection pages read from src/data
src/data/         site.ts (nav, footer, metadata) + features, industries,
                  integrations, templates
src/components/   Header, Footer, sections.tsx (shared page furniture),
                  plus the homepage's scroll-driven sections
src/lib/          install-request email handling and utils
```

`src/data/site.ts` is the single source of truth for navigation, the footer,
contact details, and the sister-site link. Adding a product page means adding
it there and creating the route.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create `.env.local` from `.env.example` before testing the CTA email flow.

`npm run lint` runs ESLint and `tsc --noEmit`. `npm test` covers the
install-request email builder.

## AI readability

`npm run build` runs `scripts/ai-readability.mjs` after `next build`. It reads the
HTML Next prerenders into `.next/server/app` and writes, into `public/`:

- a Markdown twin per indexable page, at the same path plus `.md`
- `/llms.txt`, a curated index following the llmstxt.org shape
- `/llms-full.txt`, the whole site as one Markdown document

Those outputs are generated, so they are gitignored. Running `next build` on its
own will leave them stale; use `npm run build`, or `npm run ai:check` to
regenerate them against the current `.next`.

There is one public URL per page. Agents get Markdown from that same address:

```bash
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://chatbot.om/product/smart-follow-ups/
```

Negotiation is handled by `netlify/edge-functions/markdown.ts`, which appends
`Vary: Accept` to both variants and sets the content type on the Markdown,
`llms.txt`, and `llms-full.txt`. Pages with no twin fall through to HTML.

The `.md` files are the payload, not a second address: the edge function reaches
them through an internal rewrite, and a direct request for one is redirected
`301` to the page it belongs to. There is deliberately no
`<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">`, because there is no separate
Markdown URL for it to point at.

`<link rel="canonical">` comes from `src/lib/meta.ts` via the Next Metadata API
rather than the post-build pass, because a server render leaves no HTML file to
patch. `pageMeta()`, the generator and the edge function all have to agree on
the twin mapping: `/about/` maps to `/about.md`, `/` maps to `/index.md`.

## Positioning

chatbot.om covers chat channels only: website chat, WhatsApp (including voice
notes), and email replies, plus tickets, follow-ups, the lead pipeline, and
reporting. Inbound phone calls, outbound calling campaigns, and the dedicated
AI Email Agent belong to customercare.om. `/comparison/` states the split
explicitly and should be kept in step with any capability change.

## Email CTA

The hero, the final CTA, and `/get-started/` post to `/api/install-request`.
The route uses SMTP settings and `CTA_OWNER_EMAILS` to email the owner with the
submitted website. Note that posting to it really does send mail, so avoid
exercising it against an environment that has live SMTP credentials.

## Deploy to Netlify

`netlify.toml` holds the production build settings:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `.next`
- Node.js: 22

The site is not a static export, because `/api/install-request` needs a
server. Netlify's OpenNext adapter deploys the route as a serverless function
under framework detection, so no plugin is pinned.

Before the first production deploy, add these environment variables in
**Project configuration → Environment variables**:

```text
SMTP_HOST
SMTP_PORT
SMTP_USER
SMTP_PASS
SMTP_FROM
CTA_OWNER_EMAILS
```

`CTA_OWNER_EMAILS` accepts one address or a comma-separated list. Keep
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` unset so the form calls the same Netlify origin; only set
it when intentionally hosting the API on a different domain.

After deployment, submit the install form once and confirm that the Netlify
function logs show a successful request and that the owner email arrives.
